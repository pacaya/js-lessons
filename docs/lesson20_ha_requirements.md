- after each test succeeds commit your code

- Using TDD write a function `getFizzBuzz(n: number): string` such as:
	- if a number is a multiple of ‘3’ returns “Fizz”
	- if a number is a multiple of ‘5’ return “Buzz”
	- if a number is a multiple of both ‘3’ and ‘5’ return “FizzBuzz”
	- if a number is not divisible by ‘3’ or ‘5’ return the number itself (as a string)

- Print the output of this function for the numbers from 1 to 30
